## Research interest

Our time is divided evenly between methodological work and primary data analysis of both in-house experiments from our collaborators and public datasets to provide new insights in gene regulation in health and disease.

We develop statistical methods and open-source software that are tailored to solve problems in genomic analysis in medical research. Our software is freely available as part of the Bioconductor project.

### Current projects include:

Statistical methods for modeling variation in RNA-sequencing data.
Software for interactive visualisation of gene expression data.
Software for single-cell gene expression data analysis.
Analysis of long-read sequencing data.
Exploration of epigenetic and genetic regulation in development and cancer.
